the base64.txt file thats in there is for a button that lets you use RHL in base64 
(look it up if you dont have a clue what im talking about)
it normaly copies the text inside the file when you click on it but for rn.. its just a button
if you want to use RHL base64 edition just open base64.txt and paste it into you broswers address bar

trust me for once its not a zip bomb boogerb
